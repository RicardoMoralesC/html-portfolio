<h1>The best movies according to Reach</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Pretty good movie about people getting inside their own dreams or other's to accomplish a mission. In the end you don't know if the main character made it or not. It's up to you and your own interpretation</p>

<h3>The good, the bad and the ugly</h3>
<p>3 main characters with different personalities and ambitions. Also, it's placed in the Old West. The Ecstasy of Gold is one of the best musical compositions ever.</p>

<h3>Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>The first Star Wars movie I watched in a theather. So exciting, so dark. It's even above Empire Strikes Back, for me.</p>
